# maskOS - A macOS based skin

I've created this skin because I was annoyed with the close, restore and minimize buttons on the top-right. Even tho I've put all the details like a macOS, the Steam give a damn. And that's because Steam has its own way to know which OS is running.

maskOS is a native way to make Steam look the macOS version, with a few tweaks on 2 .layout files, making the Steam think that is running on the Apple's system, changing the close, restore and minimize buttons to the left.

It also has the grayish thing when you are navigating on another window.

Iv'e applied it only on the main window, the chat and the multitask function doesn't have it.
