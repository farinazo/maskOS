# maskOS

I've created this skin because I was annoyed with the close, restore and minimize buttons on the top-right. Even tho I've put all my shit like a macOS, the Steam gave a shit. And that's because steam has it's own way to know which OS is running.

maskOS is a native way to make Steam look the macOS version, with a few tweks on 2 .layout files, who make the Steam think that is running on the Apple's system, changing the close, restore and minimize buttons to the left.

It also have the greyish thing when you are navigating on another window.

Iv'e applied it only on the main window, the chat and the multitask function doesn't have it.
